# Croxy Editor
## _Basic Code Editor Made With Nextron - Tailwind_

Croxy Editor is a code editor which ables you to edit files.

- Discord RPC feature
- Watchs folder which you added to editor
- Language System (You can add your files from ~/Documents/Croxy Code Editor/languages folder )
- ✨Magic ✨

## Known Issues

- You can't open a file with editor (It seems like you can but you can't)
- Discord RPC connection problems (sometimes)
- You can't see "node_modules" folder because of performance issues. I'll fix that on next commit.
